# You need to know Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Benefits of cloud computing
- Agility
- Elasticity
- Cost savings
- Deploy globally in minutes

## Types of cloud computing
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

## AWS services
- Computing (EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, etc.)
- Storage (S3, EFS, Glacier, Storage, Gateway)
- Database (SQL Server, Oracle, Mysql, PostGreSQL || MongoDB, Redis, CouchDB)
- Networking & Content Delivery (VPC, Route 53, CloudFront, etc.)
