- How to Build a Perf Budget

  - Build separate performance budgets for mobile devices on slow networks and desktop/laptop devices on fast networks
  - Do a performance audit
  - Set reasonable performance goals based on audit
  - Test production version against performance budget --- use the tools
  - Do a competitor performance audit: make your performance goal to be better than you compititors
  - Performance budgets are unique to each project, come out your best oneã€‚
  - Performance budgets can and will change over time --- your project changes over time
